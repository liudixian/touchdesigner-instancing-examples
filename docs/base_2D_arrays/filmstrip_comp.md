<h1>Miscellaneous Techniques</h1>
<h2>Creating a Filmstrip Illusion</h2>
<hr>

<p>
	Similar to our previous example, here we also use a <b>texture3D TOP</b> that's set to pre-fill. Here our instances are arranged based on a vertical line. The border dressing done in textures creates the illusion of a film strip. Finally, we use a <b>math CHOP</b> to seamlessly snap our filmstrip back to the top at a regular interval.
