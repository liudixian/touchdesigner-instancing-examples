<p>A typical approach to instancing uses a piece of geometry to describe the positions of our instances — this is great, but we sometimes want more complex arrangements of instances. In tools like C4D, it’s not uncommon to have clones of clones — but in TouchDesigner instancing on the GPU doesn’t work exactly like that. Instead we need to do some additional set-up work to make this possible. For static arrangements, <a href="https://docs.derivative.ca/Copy_SOP">the copy SOP</a> can be a great helper. Here the first input of the <strong>copy SOP</strong> is the shape to be copied, and the second input is the points where it will be copied.</p>

<p>In the image above, we create a sphere at each point of a reference sphere. That set of 12 spheres then becomes the source geometry to be instanced at the corner points of our box.</p>

<p>This approach is great for static sets of instances that are not overly complex. The <strong>copy SOP</strong> produces actual geometry rather than just instances on the GPU — which makes this less efficient in some cases, and not well suited for pieces that are animated. As a starting point, however, this is a great place to start understanding how instances work, and how to create complex arrangements.</p>
