<h1 id="object-chop--calculating-bearing-with-feedback">Object CHOP | Calculating Bearing with Feedback</h1>

<p>Moving a step beyond simply pointing to one reference position, this example looks at how we might be able to calculate a bearing value for each instance individually. Here we use a <strong>feedback CHOP</strong> to feed our <strong>object CHOP</strong> with a previous value — from our current position and our previous position we can derive a heading that represents the a vector between those two points. In this example we derive a bearing from that information.</p>

<p>Notice the order of operations here that ensures our rotation is correctly calculated. For 278 instances the <strong>object CHOP</strong> calculation is roughly .27ms — so it’s worth noting that there are limits to the number of simultaneous objects you’ll be able to calculate using this approach.</p>

<p>Another interesting approach in this example is the mechanism used for providing an ease-in and ease-out to our arrows. A <strong>math CHOP</strong> is used to derive the normliazed life value by dividing the current life by the total life length. The resulting value here will be from 0-1 representing the birth to death of a particle. Next we can use an <strong>s-curve CHOP</strong> with a <strong>join SOP</strong> to create a nice ease-in/out lookup that’s then used by the <strong>lookup CHOP</strong> to give smooth in and out transitions for our arrows.</p>
