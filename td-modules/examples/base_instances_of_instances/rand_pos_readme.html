    The previous technique is especially powerful when working with moving and dynamic objects. Copy SOPs can be very slow, and having a away to do this all with CHOP math helps you find highly efficient approaches for solving these kinds of problems. In this example you'll see that we use the same techniques for flattening our refernce positions, using a Math CHOP to calculate the new positions, then shuffling our data so it's back in order for instancing.
