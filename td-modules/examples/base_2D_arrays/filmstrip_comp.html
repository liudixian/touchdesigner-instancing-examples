<h1>Miscellaneous Techniques</h1>
<h2>Creating a Filmstrip Illusion</h2>
<hr>

<p>
	Similar to our previous example, here we also use a <a href="https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_3D_TOP">Texture3D TOP</a> that's set to pre-fill. Here our instances are arranged based on a vertical line. The boarder dressing done in textures creates the illusion of a films strip. Finally, we use a Math CHOP to seamlessly snap our filmstrip back to the top at a regular interval.
