<h1>Using DATs</h1>
<h2>Using an Updating Table</h2>
<hr>
<p>this is our simple random data sim we start by creating an empty dictionary / json blob then fill in our blob based on how many rows are in our target table - just for the sake of completness. if your json blobs were different sizes each time you'd need some extra data handling to make sure you had a matching number of rows in your table. this sim only updates the scale y value (sy) though you could adapt this to meet many needs
</p> 
<code>
def data_sim():

new_dict = {}
# create random vals for entry
for each in range(op('table1').numRows)[1:]:
    new_dict[each] = {
        'sy' : tdu.rand(absTime.frame + each) 
    }

    return new_dict

# run the sim, and assign it to the varible data
data = data_sim()
    
# loop through each item in the dictioary 

for each_key, each_val in data.items():
    # loop through all the keys
    for each_sub_key, each_sub_val in each_val.items():
        
        # here our key has acted as an ID which we're
        # using to match as a row identifier
        # the sub_key matches a column
        # the value of the sub_key is the value we
        # want to update
        op('table1')[each_key, each_sub_key] = each_sub_val
