<h1>Using DATs</h1>
<h2>Data Fetched with a Script CHOP</h2>
<hr>
<p>this is our simple random data sim we start by creating an empty dictionary / json blob
then fill in our blob based on how many rows are in our target table - just for the sake of completness. if your json blobs were different sizes each time you'd need some extra data handling to make sure you had a matching number of rows in your table. this sim only updates the scale y value (sy) though you could adapt this to meet many needs
</p> 
<code>
def data_sim():
    new_dict = {}

    # create random vals for entry
    for each in range(op('grid1').numPoints):
        new_dict[each] = {
            'sy' : tdu.rand(absTime.frame + each) 
        }

    return new_dict

# run the sim, and assign it to the varible data
data = data_sim()
parent().store('data', data)
</code>

<p>I think this is a bad idea, but maybe it's brilliant... the idea is that rather than looping through and changing the contents in a table, this instead updates a python dictionary that's in storage. A point SOP then extracts the appropriate value based on the indexID of the point. that operation happens in the poitn SOP - check there to see the syntax for the references.
