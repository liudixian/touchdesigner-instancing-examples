<h1>GLSL and Instances</h1>
<h2>Noise Functions for Instances</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    In this example we'll look at a simple use of simplex noise to change the sacle of our instances. In many TouchDesigner tutorials about using noise in custom materials you'll often see a custom noise function. In fact, in another example we'll use our own noise function. You can also use two built in noise functions provided by TouchDesigner: <code>TDSimplexNoise()</code> or <code>TDPerlinNoise()</code>. This functions can help save a significant amount of time when working with noise and come in several varieties. Both of these helper functions come in 2D, 3D and 4D varities. If you have a chance you should read more abou the built in noise functions on the <a href="https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_Material#Perlin_and_Simplex_noise_functions">Write a GLSL Material</a> page in the wiki.

    In this example, our magic happens on lines 21 through 24:
    <br><br>
    <code>vec3 inst_for_noise = (TDInstanceMat()[3].xyz) * u_noise_scale;

float scale     = TDSimplexNoise( vec4( inst_for_noise, u_transform.w) );
vec3 new_P      = P * scale;
</code>
    <br><br>
    We begin by using our <code>TDInstnaceMat()</code> to find the position of our instance. We'll use this value to seed our noise function, but before we do that we first scale our values by vec3 uniform. This value is then passed <code>TDSimplexNoise()</code> as a vec4 - values for x, y, z, and time. Finally we scale the vertex position based on the resulting value. 
    <br><br>
    I'd encourage you to play with the network in this example to better understand what's happening. Especially pay attention to the custom uniform <code>u_nosie_scale</code> and <code>u_transform</code>. Noise scale will allow you to adjust the scale of the noise in x, y, and z. The transform uniform will allow you to change the movement of the noise - in the x, y, z or time dimensions.
