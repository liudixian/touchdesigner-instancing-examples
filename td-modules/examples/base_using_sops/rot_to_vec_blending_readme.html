<h1>Techniques Using SOPs</h1>
<h2>Rotate to Vector and the Blend SOP</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Rather than calculating bearning manually, you may want to take advantage of another feature of instancing - Rotate to Vector. Another way we can think about this type of vector is to use tne normal's for a given point.
    In this example we use the normals from our SOPs to describe the rotation of our instances. The normals from our Surface Operators can be retrieved with a SOP to CHOP.
    <br><br>
    The other technique at play here is to use a blend SOP to morph one SOP into another. While this is a non-typical use for the blend SOP, the appliaction for instances is interesting. The blend SOP allows for multiple inputs - so while this example moves form the sphere to the long form grid arrangemnet, it would also be possible to have many different configurations of geometry that you blended between.
