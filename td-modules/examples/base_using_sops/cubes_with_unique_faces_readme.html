<h1>Techniques Using SOPs</h1>
<h2>Cube Instances with Unique Faces</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    This example comes from an old HelpGroup question about putting unique images on a faces for instances. There are a number of ways to approach this challenge. You could certainly use the approach we've outlined in other examples that focuse on instnaces of instances - where we create the cube faces individually. That's a fine approach, but here we instead focus on working with cubes. To do this, we need to use a cube map texture, and texture instancing - this isn't supported on all GPUs, so you may find that this example doesn't load on your computer. 
    <br><br>
    You'll see in the example that we instance 4 cubes, and that on our Geometry COMP we use the Instance Texture parameters. For this to work correctly we provide a path to our TOPs with a wild-card card character in place of where we'll subsititue a digit. For example:
    <br><br>
<code>textures/item*/final</code>
    <br><br>
    This is going to be expressed as the following during instancing:
    <br><br>
<code>textures/item1/final
textures/item2/final
textures/item3/final
textures/item4/final
...etc...
</code>
    <br><br>
    This is a nice way to work with whole cubes rather than trying to think of each face of each cube when working with the textures.
