<h1>Techniques Using SOPs</h1>
<h2>Image Carousel Using a Line</h2>
<p>
    Arranging instances presents an interesting challenge, especially int the use case of image carosles or photo slide-shows. In this example we look at how we might arrange images as a gallery that stretches along a line. Here the same line that's used for the instances also describes the path for our camera COMP. You could similarly transform the geometry left and right to have a similar effect.
