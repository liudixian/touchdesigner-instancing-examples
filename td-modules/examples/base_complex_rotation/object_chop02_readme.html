<h1>Complex rotation</h1>
<h2>Object CHOP | Calculating Bearing with Feedback</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Moving one step beyond simply pointing to one refernece position, this example looks at how we might be able to calculate a bearing value for each instance individually. Here we use a feedback CHOP to feed our object CHOP with a previous value - from our current position, and our previous position we can derive a heading that represents the a vector between those two points. In this example we derive a bearing from that information.

    Notice the order of operations here that ensures our rotation is correctly calculated. For 278 instances the object CHOP calculation is roughly .27ms - so it's worth noting that there are limits to the number of simultanious objects you'll be able to calculate the rotation for using this approach. 
    <br><br>
    Another interesting approach in this example is the mechanism used for providing an ease-in and ease-out to our arrows. A math CHOP is used to derive the normliazed life value by dividing the current life by the total life length. The resulting value here will be from 0-1 representing birth the death for the particle. Next we can use an s-curve CHOP with a join SOP to create a nice ease-in/out lookup that's then used by the lookup CHOP to give smooth in and out transitions for our arrows.
