<h1>Complex rotation</h1>
<h2>Manual Rotation Calculation</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	An example made back when I hardly knew what I was doing - the principle of this exercise was seemingly simple. It started with a question if each instance could have a unique look-at style rotation. This examples explores just that question. Here there are six arrows pointing towards a coresponding sphere whose movement is random. A line acts as ray that passes from the tip of the arrow through the sphere to visually debug the scene and ensure that our rotation is working correctly.
